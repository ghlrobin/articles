I write about what I learned, provide guides on things I am interested in and share my opinions on variety of topics. Naturally, the website is separated into three main sections:

1. [Knowledge base](https://robinglee.com/knowledge-base/)
	- This is where I keep my semi-formal academic notes on topics like quantum computing, machine learning, finance, statistics and time-series analysis.
	- If you are interested in these topics, you might find something useful there.
2. [Guides](https://robinglee.com/guides/)
	- You will find well-thought-out guides on programming, tech, and other miscellaneous topics so that people (most likely future me) spend less time searching for the same fix.
3. [Blog](https://robinglee.com/blog/)
	- This is the corner of the site that is most laidback. Here, I will write freely about anything that comes to my mind.
