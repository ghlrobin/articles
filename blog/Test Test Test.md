## Notes

This is a test on my new workflow:
1. Use Obsidian Git community plugin to push to ghlrobin/articles (public repo) where I store all my articles for the website
2. Github Actions requests ghlrobin/blog (private repo), which has ghlrobin/articles as a submodule, to commit and merge (or update... I am not sure whether this is the right thing to say) the main repo.

This is a new sentence
